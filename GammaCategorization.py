Gamma Categorization

    -> Design patterns are typically split into three categories
    -> This is called Gamma Categorization after Erich Gamma, one of GoF authors

    -> Creational Patterns
        --> Deal with the creation (construction) of objects
        --> Explicit (constructor) vs implicit (DI, reflection, etc.)
        --> Wholesale (single statement) vs. piecewise (step-by-step)

    -> Structure Patterns
        --> Concerned with the structure (e.g, class members)
        --> Many patterns are wrappers that mimic the uderlying class interface
        --> Stress the importance of good API design

    -> Behavioral Patterns
        --> They all different; no central theme
